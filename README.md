90snick Twitter Bot

My bot downloads a specified user's tweets and uses an Ngram Model to tweet ranodmly generated sentences built from this data.
In addition, it includes functionality to automatically follow other users.
In order to use this you must create a config.txt file containing the 4 OAuth keys provided by twitter and the username
for the user whose tweets you would like to download.
